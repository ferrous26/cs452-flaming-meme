\section*{Overview}

This kernel development milestone adds handling for hardware
interrupts, a clock server, and system calls for event handling and
communication with the clock server. This milestone also includes a
task that demonstrates the clock servers abilities.

\section*{Operation Instructions}

A pre-compiled kernel exists at
\ttt{/u/cs452/tftp/ARM/marada/k3.elf}, which can be loaded with
RedBoot using the following command:

\begin{center}
  \ttt{load -h 10.15.167.4 ARM/marada/k3.elf; go}
\end{center}

Notice that no offset should be specified for the load instruction.

The source code for the kernel exists in \ttt{/u3/marada/kernel2/},
and can be compiled with the following command chain:

\begin{center}
  \ttt{cd /u3/marada/kernel2 \&\& source /u3/marada/.cs452 \&\& make clean \&\& make}
\end{center}

Which will produce a \ttt{kernel.elf} file in the same directory as
the makefile built in debug mode with minimal optimizations enabled.

After Initialization the kernel will respond with the message ``\ttt{Welcome to
Task Launcher}''.
At this point the key \ttt{1} will start the clock server
demonstration. The \ttt{h} key will print a list of other commands
which are available to demonstrate features added in this milestone.

\section*{Hardware Interrupts}

\subsection*{AwaitEvent()}

The signature we chose for events is
\ttt{int AwaitEvent(int eventid, char* event, int eventlen)}. We chose
this in anticipation of handling UART FIFO I/O in the next
milestone.

The only \ttt{eventid} that is supported right now is
\ttt{CLOCK\_TICK}.

We have optimized this for clock events, which will receive a result
code of 0 when the event goes off.
